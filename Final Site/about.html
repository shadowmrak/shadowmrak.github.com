			<p>Stephanie Hurley passed away on July 29, 2008 while stationed in Austin, Texas.

			Steph was a native of Brookfield, Massachusetts. From a young age, Stephanie always showed a vested interest in animals and horse-back riding.  She began riding at age 3 and later worked for 4H, a camp which empowers youth to reach their full potential, working and learning in partnership with caring adults. From the beginning Stephanie had natural leadership qualities which would help her to succeed above and beyond expectations.

			In High School, Stephanie excelled in and out of the classroom. She graduated from Tantasqua Regional Senior High School as a part of the class of 2003. During her time at Tantasqua, Stephanie made a lasting impression on classmates and faculty alike. She is remembered as an accomplished student and a caring friend.

			 Stephanie developed an interest in the field of Criminal Justice, which eventually led her to join the Army National Guard.  At the beginning of her junior year she received a two-year Guaranteed Reserve Forces Duty scholarship (GRFD) from the Army.  Stephanie commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant into the Army National Guard and as a finance officer for the Texas Army National Guard upon completion of her training. She hoped to one day become a part of the FBI after her military accomplishment.

			She graduated summa cum laude with a 3.69 GPA from Norwich in 2007 with a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice. She also spent 8 consecutive semesters on the Deans list and received the COL Conrad D. Whitney Award for military excellence. While attending Norwich, she dedicated much of her time to the Women’s Rugby team, of which she was captain during her junior and senior years. She helped her team to become first in the North East and third in the country at the National Elite 8 Rugby finals in Florida. 

			Stephanie was a beloved daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin, and aunt. Her loyalty was to her family and her friends. She brought great passion and enthusiasm to all of her endeavors. She was a natural born leader and accomplished everything she set her mind to. She loved her family, her Norwich family, her dog Mia, her Ford Mustang and her niece Rylie, who was born shortly before Stephanie’s unexpected death. After her passing she was awarded three medals, The Meritorious Service Medal, The Army Commendation Medal and The Army Achievement Medal. 

			Stephanie Maree Hurley passed away unexpectedly on July 29, 2008 at the age of 23.
